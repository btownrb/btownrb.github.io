# Btown.rb

Btownrb.org is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/), a general-purpose static site generator.

## Getting Started

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) and check out the [Hugo Quickstart Guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/).

The Btown.rb source code is on the `source` branch. The `master` branch contains the static site that's generated by Hugo, which is what's being served at [http://btownrb.org](http://btownrb.org).

To work with the code, clone the source branch:

```shell
git clone -b source git@github.com:btownrb/btownrb.github.io.git btownrb
```

To deploy, generate the static site with Hugo:

```shell
# Within the btownrb directory...
hugo
```

Commit the results:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Made some sweet updates."
```

Push the source branch (make sure you pull first!):

```shell
git push
```

Then push the contents of `/public` to the master branch:

```shell
git push origin `git subtree split --prefix public source`:master
```
