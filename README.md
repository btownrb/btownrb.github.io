# Btown.rb

Btownrb.org is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/), a general-purpose static site generator.

The source code is on the `source` branch. The `master` branch contains the actual static site that's generated by Hugo, and that's being served at [http://btownrb.org](http://btownrb.org).
